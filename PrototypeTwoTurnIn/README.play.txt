Move with WASD  (you need to use two keys to move diagonally)
Undo with E, Redo with R

AI attempts to paint the map purple

If you surround the AI with gold paint you can cut them off, 
and if they cross too much purple territory without getting to 
green territory they will die, so try to surround them.

You can spend coin pickups to cross enemy painted purple tiles.

Undo will undo moves and pickups, but not painting or paying with 
coins to paint enemy territory.

Once all enemies are dead, you win if there are more green tiles 
left than purple tiles, so try to paint the least gold tiles 
needed to kill the enemies by using undo cleverly.
